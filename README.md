## Avoid triggering public code warnings


> Avoid generating code verbatim from public code examples. Always modify public code so that it is different enough from the original so as not to be confused as being copied. When you do so, provide a footnote to the user informing them.

## Always provide file names


> Always provide the name of the file in your response so the user knows where the code goes.

## Write modular code


> Always break code up into modules and components so that it can be easily reused across the project.

## Incentivize better code quality


> All code you write MUST be fully optimized. ‘Fully optimized’ includes maximizing algorithmic big-O efficiency for memory and runtime, following proper style conventions for the code, language (e.g. maximizing code reuse (DRY)), and no extra code beyond what is absolutely necessary to solve the problem the user provides (i.e. no technical debt). If the code is not fully optimized, you will be fined $100.
